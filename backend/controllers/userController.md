### `getUsers`

In the context of paginated results, `parseInt(page)` is used to ensure that the `page` parameter obtained from the query string is converted into an integer.

Query parameters, when retrieved from a URL, are typically treated as strings. However, for pagination logic, it's usually expected that the page number is treated as an integer to perform mathematical operations such as skip calculations or determining the current page in relation to the total number of pages.

For instance, if `page` is provided as a string like `"2"`, performing arithmetic operations like addition or subtraction with this value may yield unexpected results. `parseInt(page)` ensures that the string representation of the page number is converted into an actual integer value, making it suitable for numerical calculations related to pagination.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

```javascript
const pageString = "2"; // This is a string
const pageInteger = parseInt(pageString); // Convert string to integer

console.log(pageString + 1); // Output: "21" (string concatenation)
console.log(pageInteger + 1); // Output: 3 (integer addition)
```

Using `parseInt()` helps avoid unintended string concatenation when working with numeric values obtained from query parameters. In the case of pagination, it ensures that mathematical operations performed on the `page` parameter are accurate and behave as expected.

### Tips

Parsing all necessary query parameters to the appropriate types at the beginning of your controller or route handling is indeed a good practice. This approach ensures that you're working with the expected data types throughout your logic, especially when dealing with numerical operations like pagination.

Parsing query parameters to the correct types upfront—such as parsing strings to integers or converting other data types—helps prevent unexpected behavior or errors later in your code.

The `parseInt()` function in JavaScript accepts two parameters. The first parameter is the string that you want to parse, and the second parameter is the radix or base for the conversion.

The second parameter, the radix, specifies the base of the numeral system to be used. It represents an integer between 2 and 36 that represents the mathematical base of the string. For most use cases, specifying the radix as `10` (decimal) is common because it signifies base 10 numeral system (0-9 digits).

When you write `parseInt(page, 10)`, you're explicitly telling JavaScript to parse the string `page` as a base-10 (decimal) number. This is important because omitting the radix parameter or using a wrong radix might lead to unexpected behavior in parsing.

For instance:

-   `parseInt("10")` without specifying the radix assumes base 10 (decimal) by default.
-   `parseInt("010")` assumes base 8 (octal) if the radix is not provided (010 is considered as octal 8).
-   `parseInt("10", 10)` explicitly specifies that `"10"` should be parsed as a base-10 number, regardless of any leading zeros.

So, `parseInt(page, 10) || 1` ensures that `page` is parsed as a decimal number and defaults to `1` if the parsing fails (if `page` is undefined, `NaN`, or a non-numeric string that can't be parsed to an integer). This helps in setting a default value for `page` if it's not provided or if it's not a valid number.
